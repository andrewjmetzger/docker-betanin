# docker-betanin
A Dockerfile for [Betanin](https://github.com/sentriz/betanin) with extra beets [community plugins](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins/index.html) added.

# Plugins:
  * [beetcamp](https://github.com/snejus/beetcamp): enables bandcamp.com autotagger with a fairly extensive amount of metadata.
  * [beets-filetote](https://github.com/gtronset/beets-filetote/): moves non-music extra files, attachments, and artifacts during imports and CLI file manipulation actions (move, modify, reimport, etc.)
  * [beets-follow](https://github.com/nolsto/beets-follow): lets you check for new albums from artists you like.
  * [drop2beets](https://github.com/martinkirch/drop2beets): imports singles as soon as they are dropped in a folder.
  * [beets-originquery](https://github.com/x1ppy/beets-originquery): uses supplemental files in imported directories to improve MusicBrainz matches for untagged data.
